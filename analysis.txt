Task 0:

Array Access: O(1)
Only need single items from list; these require index operations, which are constant time complexity

Task 1:

Loops and Sets: O(n)
Uses 2 loops to add values to sets, which are linear time complexity
Adding values to sets are constant time complexity

Task 2: 

Loop: O(n)
Uses loop to add values to dictionary, is a linear time complexity
Adding values to dictionary are constant time complexity
Searches for maximum value of dictionary, which is a linear time complexity

Task 3:

Loop: O(n^2)
getPrefix splits string, which is linear time complexity
getPrefix accesses string values, which is constant time complexity
findBangladoreCallers loops through all calls, which is linear time complexity, then loops through strings, which is quadratic time complexity
findBangladoreCallers adds values to set, which is constant time complexity
findBangladoreCallers sorts values of set, which is linearithmic time complexity
findBangladoreCallers loops through set, which is linear time complexity
findBangladoreToBangladoreCallers loops through all calls, which is linear time complexity
findBangladoreToBangladoreCallers appends numbers to list, which are constant time complexity
findBangladoreToBangladoreCallers divides lengths of lists, which are constant time complexity


Task 4:

Loops and Sets: O(n log n)
Loops through csv and sets which is linear time complexity
Adds and removes values to sets which are constant time complexity
Sorts values of set, which is linearithmic time complexity
